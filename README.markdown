# Partial Table

## Description

An example iOS project to show how to load a subset of data in a table view with
a "Display More** button loads more data into the table.

This is meant to be very simple. A concrete example of the concept.

**Updated for SwiftUI**

There are tags for the Objective-C, and Swift versions. See the _Requirements_ section for details

Currently, this is achieved by having a single cell in a second section and loading more data from there.
