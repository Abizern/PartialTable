# Partial Table

## Description

An example iOS project to show how to load a subset of data in a table view with
a "Display More" button loads more data into the table.

There are tags for the Objective-C, Swift 1.2, 2.0 and 2.2 versions.

Currently, this is achieved by having a single cell in a second section and loading more data from there.

This is meant to be very simple. A concrete example of the concept.

## Requirements

### Swift 4.2 (tag 5.0)
- iOS 12
- Xcode 10

### Swift 4.0 (tag 4.1)

This uses the new iOS 11 UITableViewMethod `performBatchUpdates` to update the tableview.

### Swift 4.0 (tag 4.0)
- iOS 10
- Xcode 9

This rewrites in this version are more than just updating to the new Swift version, but also because I'm a better developer now than I was when I started this project and I do things a little differently now.

### Swift 3.0 (tag 3.0)
- iOS 10+
- Xcode 8

### Swift 2.2
- iOS 9.0+
- Xcode 7.3

### Swift 2
