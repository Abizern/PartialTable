#Partial Table

##Description

An example iOS project to show how to load a subset of data in a table view with
a "Display More" button loads more data into the table.

There are tags for the Objective-C, Swift 1.2, 2.0 and 2.2 versions.

Currently, this is achieved by having a single cell in a second section and loading more data from there.

This is meant to be very simple. A concrete example of the concept.
